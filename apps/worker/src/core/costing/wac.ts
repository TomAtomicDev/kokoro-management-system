// core/costing — pure weighted-average-cost (WAC) math (KOK-013).
// Doc 03 §4 "Costing rules (normative)" C-1, C-2, C-6; Doc 03 §7 "Correction & recalculation
// policy" R-2. Every function in this file is a plain, synchronous, DB-free computation — no `Db`
// parameter, nothing async — so it is trivially usable both by future event services (purchases
// KOK-016, production KOK-026) and by fast-check property tests (Doc 11 §2).
//
// Convention (matches core/inventory, see movements.ts): `wac` / `entryUnitCost` / the return
// value of every function here are CENTAVOS PER MILLI-UNIT (a deliberately-float quantity, Doc 04
// §2/§3.4), the exact same unit as `stock_movements.unit_cost`. A value produced here can be
// passed straight into a StockMovementInput's `unitCost` field with no conversion. `on_hand` /
// `qty` values are milli-unit integers.
//
// ADJUST-vs-entry reasoning (C-1/C-6, KB-amendment-worthy — Doc 03 does not spell this out in so
// many words, see the report for this task):
// C-1 says WAC updates on every stock ENTRY with an externally-given unit cost `c`. C-6 groups
// ADJUST together with true exits (SALE_OUT/EXIT_OUT/PRODUCTION_OUT) for VALUATION purposes: "exits
// and count adjustments value at current WAC". A positive ADJUST (an inventory count that found
// MORE stock than the system expected) is therefore NOT treated as a C-1 entry, even though it
// increases on-hand qty like an entry would: its `unit_cost` is whatever WAC already was at the
// time the movement was written (i.e. it is DERIVED FROM the WAC, per C-6), so feeding it back
// into the C-1 formula as if it were an externally-priced entry would be circular and would let an
// inventory-count correction silently drag the WAC toward itself. Only PURCHASE_IN and
// PRODUCTION_IN — movements that carry a genuine externally-given cost (a purchase invoice line, a
// production run's computed output cost) — trigger the C-1 update. This is encoded below by
// `recomputeWacFromMovements`'s `ENTRY_TYPES` set and mirrored by every future exit-valuing
// service, which must call `snapshotUnitCost`/`getCurrentWac` (repair.ts) rather than ever calling
// `applyWacEntry` for an ADJUST or exit movement.
